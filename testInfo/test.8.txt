Title: Test 8 - Immediate Connection Delayed Requests fir Same File
Group number: 4
Purpose: Serve a multiple requests for the same file over a short period of time.
How it works: The file is requested as soon as the client connects, then again
              repeatedly over an interval of 0.1s.
Expected result: SJF: The files are all of the same length, finish in order of
                      request time.
                 RR: The requests are completed before the next request arrives.
                 MLFB: All files are finished in high priority queue before next
                 request arrives.

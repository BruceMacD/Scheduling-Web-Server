Title: Test 7 - 100 files of scattered sizes
Group number: 4
Purpose: Test that many files will behave properly
How it works: All 100 files are fed in at once.
Expected result: SJF: Files are finished once after another, in increasing order
					of size.
                 RR: The files are both finished in one step each, with request
                     at zero seconds being completed before the second request
                     arrives.
                 MLFB: The files are both finished in the high priority queue,
                       with request at zero seconds being completed before the
                       second request arrives.

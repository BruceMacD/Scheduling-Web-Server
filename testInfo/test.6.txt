Title: Test 6 - Three Different Files With Different Connection Times
Group number: 4
Purpose: Serve a request for a small, medium and large file with different connection times

How it works: Connection for large file is made first followed by connections for the small and medium sized files 1 second later.
            
Expected result: SJF: The large file will be completely processed first, followed 
		      by the small file and then the medium sized file.
                 RR: The large file is placed in the round robin scheduler 10 times
		      and processed before requests for the small and medium sized 	
		      files which both require one round to be processed.
                 MLFB: The large file finishes in the Round Robin queue,
                       before the small and medium file requests are made. 
		       The small and medium file requests finish in the high priority queue.

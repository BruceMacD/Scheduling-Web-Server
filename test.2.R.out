Title: Test 2 - Two Small Files With Request Delay
Group number: 4
Purpose: Serve a request for two small files, one at zero seconds then another
         after 2 seconds.
How it works: One file requested as soon as the client connects, the next is
              requested 2 seconds later.
Expected result: SJF: The files are both finished in one step each, with request
                      at zero seconds being completed before the second request
                      arrives.
                 RR: The files are both finished in one step each, with request
                     at zero seconds being completed before the second request
                     arrives.
                 MLFB: The files are both finished in the high priority queue,
                       with request at zero seconds being completed before the
                       second request arrives.
